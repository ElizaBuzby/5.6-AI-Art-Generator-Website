        <p>Odds are, you've heard of AI Art. It's a popular topic, and incredibly controversial for a multitude of reasons. </p>
    </section>

    <section id="IntroduceAI">
        <h3>What is AI?</h3>
        <p>AI is defined as Artificial Intelligence, since AI is composed of computers that try to mimic human intelligence. As implied by the name, AI Art Generators have the ability to create art.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="WhyThis">
        <h3>Why Did I Choose This Topic?</h3>
        <p>As an artist, I'm intrigued in AI, and how it has affected the art community, because of the risks it poses to artists. Along with that, I've always found the idea of AI interesting, since the it's based off of preexisting artwork created by people, which will always have errors, preventing AI from every being perfect, as it was designed to be. This creates an interesting paradox. </p>
