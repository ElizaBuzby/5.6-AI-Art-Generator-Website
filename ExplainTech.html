            <h3>What Are AI Generators?</h3>
            <p>Art generators have the ability to create an image based on a prompt the user enters. This is made possible through the AI's <b>database.</b> However, AI is not perfect, and makes mistakes, and these mistakes can be noticed pretty easily, such as AI's continued difficulty with drawing hands. </p>

            <h3>What Are AI Databases?</h3>
            <p>AI Databases are collections of pictures or art made by artists. The databases are the backbone for the AI, since the AI bases the images it makes off of the preexisting art. AI databases result in AI being considered more controversial, since it's suspected that they are made up of stolen art, since many artists who have had their work inserted into AI databases hadn't consented for their art to be submitted.</p>
